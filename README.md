# ZOO800_FINAL
Repository for final ZOO800 analysis project, fall 2025.

12.15.2025: Commit work to github; submit on Canvas.

12.16.2025: Last minute edits... it's been hard to know where to start/stop with this project b/c of how related it is to my MS work,
and with how deep in the weeds I am on said work. I've done my best to meet project requirements while staying within the confines 
on my MS workflow, for my own sanity, which perhaps means extra detail in some places and lacking detail in others, since there's just 
simply so much more analysis to do to even feel good about what I have here.
Hopefully you understand where I'm coming from and see, in my code, how helpful this class has been to my growth this semester. 
Thank you, thank you!
